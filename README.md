# Heart-calculation-using-ECG-data
This code for how to calculate the heart rate of someone using his ECG data on Matlab and ploting His ECG in addition determining if his HR is normal or Abnormal

## Overview:
This program is for select an ECG data and represent it on a graph using the plot function on MATLAB, in addition calculate the heart rate in minutes and seconds and in the last we check if this person has any myocardial dysfunction for example: it is known that the normal range for heart rate is (60 – 100) BPM
If it became more than 100 BPM we can decide that this person has tachycardia as well as if the person’s heart rate became less than 60 BPM we deduce that he has bradycardia
